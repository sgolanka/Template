[^fn1]
- 'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves 
- Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
- All mimsy were the borogoves,
- And the mome raths outgrabe.

- "Beware the Jabberwock, my son 
- The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
- Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun 
- The frumious Bandersnatch!"

- He took his vorpal sword in hand; [^fn2]
- Long time the manxome foe he sought â€“
- So rested he by the Tumtum tree, 
- And stood awhile in thought.

- And, as in uffish thought he stood, 
- The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
- Came whiffling through the tulgey wood, 
- And burbled as it came!

- One, two! One, two! And through and through 
- The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
- He left it dead, and with its head 
- He went galumphing back.

- "And hast thou slain the Jabberwock? 
- Come to my arms, my beamish boy!
- O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!" 
- He chortled in his joy.

- 'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves 
- Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;[^fn3]
- All mimsy were the borogoves,
- And the mome raths outgrabe.

## Footnotes

[^fn1]:
     From <i>Through the Looking Glass and What Alice Found There </i>(1872). This book contains other great poems, including <i>The Walrus and the Carpenter</i>.  Here is a bit of it:
  
     > - "The time has come," the Walrus said,
     > - "To talk of many things:
     > - Of shoes--and ships--and sealing-wax--
     > - Of cabbages--and kings--
     > - And whether pigs have wings."

[^fn2]: Vorpal is made up of course, but is now used in games like Dungeons and Dragons to refer to a magic sword.

[^fn3]: Compare and Contrast: gyre vs gimble
