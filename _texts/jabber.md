[^fn1]
- 'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves 
- Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
- All mimsy were the borogoves,
- And the mome raths outgrabe.

- "Beware the Jabberwock, my son 
- The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
- Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun 
- The frumious Bandersnatch!"

- He took his vorpal sword in hand; 
- Long time the manxome foe he sought –
- So rested he by the Tumtum tree, 
- And stood awhile in thought.

- And, as in uffish thought he stood, 
- The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
- Came whiffling through the tulgey wood, 
- And burbled as it came!

- One, two! One, two! And through and through 
- The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
- He left it dead, and with its head 
- He went galumphing back.

- "And hast thou slain the Jabberwock? 
- Come to my arms, my beamish boy!
- O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!" 
- He chortled in his joy.

- 'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves 
- Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
- All mimsy were the borogoves,
- And the mome raths outgrabe.

- O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done;
- The ship has weather’d every rack, the prize we sought is won,
- The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,
- While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring; 
- {:.indent-3}But O heart! heart! heart!
- {:.indent-4}O the bleeding drops of red,
- {:.indent-5}Where on the deck my Captain lies,
- {:.indent-6}Fallen cold and dead.

- O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells; 
- Rise up—for you the flag is flung—for you the bugle[^fn2] trills,
- For you bouquets and ribbon’d wreaths—for you the shores a-crowding,
- For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;
- {:.indent-3}Here Captain! dear father!
- {:.indent-4}This arm beneath your head!
- {:.indent-5}It is some dream that on the deck,
- {:.indent-6}You’ve fallen cold and dead.


- My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,[^fn3]
- My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,
- The ship is anchor’d safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,
- From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;
- {:.indent-3}Exult O shores, and ring O bells!
- {:.indent-4}But I with mournful tread,
- {:.indent-5}Walk the deck my Captain lies,
- {:.indent-6}Fallen cold and dead.

## Footnotes

[^fn1]: 

	From Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There, 1872. Besides Jabberwocky, this book includes another great poem entitled The Walrus and the Carpenter.  Here's a bit:

  > - "The time has come," the Walrus said,
  > - "To talk of many things:
  > - Of shoes--and ships--and sealing-wax--
  > - Of cabbages--and kings--
  > - And why the sea is boiling hot--
  > - And whether pigs have wings."
	{:.poetry}

[^fn2]: The bugle is a small trumpet implicated in the military industrial complex.

[^fn3]: Another footnote. Why not?
