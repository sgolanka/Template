I am typing a bunch of words to create a sentence that will be part of a paragraph. Or maybe part of text that I will try to display in a few different ways.

Supposedly a blank line in the middle of (otherwise unformatted) text will produced a blank line. This text is below a blank line.



But multiple blank lines, like the ones that this line follows, will be treated as one blank line.  Another way to produce a blank line would be to add two backslashes to the end of a line like at the end of this one.\\
This line is typed right below the one above, but the one above ends with two slashes.           
Yet another way would be to add at least 2 blank spaces to the end of a line. The line above ends with many blank spaces.

I skipped a line (created a blank line) above this. I am ending this line with 2 slashes, and below this, the above text is repeated, but formatted with dashes to make each line separate. The blank lines and slashes are left in place.\\
